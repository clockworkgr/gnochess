title: 'About GnoChess'
---

GopherCon is the most hotly anticipated event on the gopher community’s calendar. A place where gophers from around the world get together to exchange ideas, share their work, and expand the Go network. What better place to spread the word about Gno.land and show web2 developers how easily they can port their apps to web3 or build new ones from scratch? And why not have a little fun while doing it?

As a gold sponsor at GC23, we wanted to spotlight Gno, not only through an interactive workshop where Go devs develop and deploy smart contracts but also through a little friendly competition! That’s how GnoChess was born. After building a web3 chess server, attendees play chess against other gophers for their chance to win the title – and scoop up some seriously cool prizes. Even the lowliest pawn can become a king or queen, as you don’t need any technical skills to play. Simply access the link from your personal device and get castling!
